## `Rio is Fast | Rio Terminal`
#Omnivore

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/rio-is-fast-rio-terminal-1922437783e) / [Read Original](https://raphamorim.io/rio/ja/docs/features/rio-is-fast/)

## Notes

> Rio is perceived fast, there's few reasons behind the speed. First reason is that Rio is built in Rust ("Speed of Rust vs C" kornel.ski/rust-c-speed). The terminal is also built over ANSI handler and parser is built from Alacritty terminal's VTE github.com/alacritty/vte.
